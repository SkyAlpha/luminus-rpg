/**
 * A `Stick` is a virtual joystick. It belongs to the Virtual Joystick Plugin which is responsible for creating and updating it.
 *
 * Create a new stick by using the `VirtualJoystickPlugin.addStick` method.
 *
 * It consists of two Sprites: one representing the 'base' of the joystick and the other the 'stick' itself, which is the part
 * that the player grabs hold of and interacts with. As the stick is moved you can read back the force being applied, either globally
 * or on a per axis basis.
 *
 * The Stick can either be on-screen all the time, positioned via the `posX` and `posY` setters. Or you can have it only appear when the
 * player touches the screen by setting `showOnTouch` to true.
 *
 * The Stick sprites are automatically added to the Scene at the point this Stick is created.
 *
 * Stick force values are analogue, that is they are values between 0 and 1 that vary depending on how the stick
 * is being moved. This allows players to have fine-grained control over your game. If you require just an 'on / off' response you may
 * wish to use the DPad class instead.
